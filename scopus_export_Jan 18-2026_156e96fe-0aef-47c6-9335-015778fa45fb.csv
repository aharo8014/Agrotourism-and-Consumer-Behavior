The current study aimed to explore the impact of perceived value on consumer’s attitudes and intentions to use indoor smart farm restaurant systems in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, using a value–attitude–behavior framework. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 110 participants, and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to assess the hypothesized relationships. The final measurement model showed acceptable levels of convergent and discriminant validity. The results of the structural model demonstrated that the perceived value significantly predicted both attitudes (β = 0.687, p < 0.001) and intentions to use (β = 0.308, p = 0.002). Attitudes also had a direct positive effect on the intention to use (β = 0.557, p = 0.001) and significantly mediated the relationship between perceived value and intention (indirect effect β = 0.383, p = 0.003), accounting for 55.4% of the total effect. These results highlight the positive effect of perceived value in shaping favorable consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions towards the adoption of smart farm restaurant systems. As a consequence, targeting consumer perceived values would influence the behavioral attributes of consumers and support sustainable agritourism innovations in Saudi Arabia and beyond. © 2025 by the authors.","agri-tourism; behavioral intention; consumer behavior; perceived value; smart farm restaurants","","","","","","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University; King Faisal University, KFU, (KFU253574)","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [Grant No. KFU253574].","Ahmmadi, Parisa, Theory of planned behavior to predict consumer behavior in using products irrigated with purified wastewater in Iran consumer, Journal of Cleaner Production, 296, (2021); Busby, Graham D., The transition from tourism on farms to farm tourism, Tourism Management, 21, 6, pp. 635-642, (2000); Choo, Hyungsuk, The Role of Agritourism Farms’ Characteristics on the Performance: A Case Study of Agritourism Farm in South Korea, International Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Administration, 23, 3, pp. 464-477, (2022); Chuang, Juihsiung, Farmers’ knowledge, attitude, and adoption of smart agriculture technology in Taiwan, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 19, pp. 1-8, (2020); Doheim, R.

E-commerce live streaming gives rural enterprises a new channel through scenario-building and interaction, while agro-tourism integration combines resources to generate a variety of promotion scenarios. This study examines the effects of external stimuli, including social networks, resource endowment, infrastructure, and the characteristics of e-commerce streamers, on the perception, trust, perceived value, and purchase intention of green consumption. It is based on the SOR (Stimulus–Organism–Response) theoretical model and focuses on e-commerce live streaming in the agriculture-tourism integration scenario. According to a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of 350 consumer questionnaires, these external stimuli primarily influence purchase intention through perceived value, trust, and green consumption cognition, with resource endowment having the most significant impact. The effects of infrastructure on perceived value and streamer attractiveness on green consumption cognition are not statistically significant. This research not only broadens the use of the SOR model in the emerging field of agritourism integration but also offers rural businesses theoretical backing and useful guidance to maximize e-commerce live marketing and enhance agritourism integration. © 2025 by the authors.","e-commerce live streaming; green agricultural products; integration of agriculture and tourism; purchase intention; SOR model; sustainability","cognition; electronic commerce; equation; green economy; marketing; sustainability; sustainable development","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (20YJCZH061); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE","This research was financially supported by the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Fund, NO. 20YJCZH061.","Dong, Xiaoxu, The Role of Live-Streaming E-Commerce on Consumers’ Purchasing Intention regarding Green Agricultural Products, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 7, (2022); Tuch, Alexandre N., The role of visual complexity and prototypicality regarding first impression of websites: Working towards understanding aesthetic judgments, International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 70, 11, pp. 794-811, (2012); Yang, Shubo, Natural resource endowment and urban green total factor productivity: “Resource gospel” or “resource curse”?, Natural Resources Forum, 49, 3, pp. 3225-3247, (2025); Zheng, Shi, Enhancing Sales of Green Agricultural Products through Live Streaming in China: What Affects Purchase Intention?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 7, (2023); China Bus Mark, (2021); Lu, Benjiang, Live streaming commerce and consumers’ purchase intention: An uncertainty reduction perspective, Information and Management, 58, 7, (2021); Zhang, Peilin, Effects of in-store live stream on consumers’ offline purchase intention, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 72, (2023); Nakasone, Eduardo, The power of information: The ICT revolution in agricultural development, Annual Review of Resource Economics, 6, 1, pp. 533-550, (2014); Ma, Longbo, Analysis of Chinese consumers’ willingness and behavioral change to purchase Green agri-food product online, PLOS ONE, 17, 4 April 2022, (2022); Xin, Baogui, Strategic product showcasing mode of E-commerce live streaming, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 73, (2023)","W.

This study examines the effects of video maturity and content empowerment on consumer behavior by focusing on dimensions such as clarity, coherence, emotional appeal, entertainment, information, and practicality. Survey data from 527 Taiwanese consumers, analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), reveal that video clarity (β = 0.105, p < 0.05) and coherence (β = 0.163, p < 0.01) significantly enhance trust, while flow experience exhibits an even stronger positive impact (β = 0.372, p < 0.001). Among content factors, knowledge has the most pronounced effect on flow experience (β = 0.440, p < 0.001), followed by emotionality, entertainment, and practicality. Moreover, both trust (β = 0.177, p < 0.001) and flow experience (β = 0.240, p < 0.001) positively influence purchase intentions, with the effect of flow experience being more dominant. These findings underscore the importance of high clarity, coherent narratives, and immersive emotional engagement in agritourism video marketing. The study makes significant theoretical contributions by refining the understanding of video-based consumer engagement, and it offers practical insights for enhancing agritourism promotional strategies. © 2025 by the authors.","agricultural tourism; coherence; digital marketing; flow experience; purchase intentions; trust; video clarity","geotourism; marketing; tourism development; tourism management; tourist attraction; videography; Taiwan","","","","","","","J Komun Malays J Commun, (2023); J Emba J Ris Ekon Manaj Bisnis Dan Akunt, (2023); Int J Econ Manag Res, (2023); Jingga, Fredy, User Behavior Analysis of Short-form Video Prolonging Usage towards Purchase Intention on social media using SEM Method, (2023); Juszka, Dawid, Impact of Content on Subjective Quality of Experience Assessment for 3D Video, pp. 29-38, (2022); Liu, Xin, Multi-scale WS-SSIM for panoramic video quality assessment, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 11550, (2020); Lemon, Katherine N., Understanding customer experience throughout the customer journey, Journal of Marketing, 80, 6, pp. 69-96, (2016); Bart, Yakov, Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

However, the merger of behavior theories with practice, especially the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), into this field remains underexplored. This study provides a bibliometric analysis to examine TPB applications in agritourism, revealing research trends and thematic evolution (1998:2025). Specifically, the dataset of 994 relevant documents was collected from the Scopus (738) and Web of Science (623) databases, and it was analyzed using the Bibliometrix and ggplot2 packages in R to clean the data, visualize the charts. Moreover, VOSviewer software was used to identify co-citation networks, clusters and co-occurrences. The results show that while the TPB has been widely used in sustainable tourism, its use in agritourism is limited, with lead authors like Ajzen, Fishbein and Han H. publishing research. Most studies were conducted in developed countries (e.g., the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany), though China and India have recently contributed. Keyword mapping reveals five main themes including TPB constructs, sustainability, digital transformation, consumer behavior and climate change. TPB-related studies emphasize engagement and increase applications beyond behavioral outcomes, providing new insights for the development of agritourism and rural tourism. © 2025 The Author(s).

Tourism creates opportunities to diversify the economy, retain traditions, improve local income, and protect natural resources. This study covered Međugorje, Ilijaš, Rostovo, Vlašić, Bosanska Krupa, Neum, Olovo, Gornji Vakuf, Sarajevo, and Donji Vakuf. Agritourism can provide authentic experiences like learning about traditional agriculture, fruit harvesting, tasting local products, and environmental preservation in destinations like Međugorje and Neum. Ilijaš and Gornji Vakuf have potential in organic production, while agricultural facilities in Vlašić may attract people seeking outdoor activities like hiking and skiing. Bosanska Krupa and Olovo have the potential to create one-of-a-kind agritourism experiences by leveraging their rich natural and cultural history. In addition to economic benefits, agritourism can help to preserve local culture and traditions. This is especially important in nations that are modernising and globalising. Agritourism allows tourists to gain a better understanding and respect for the local culture and traditions. The integration of agritourism within Bosnia and Herzegovina’s larger tourist offering is potentially the key to success in rural economic development and sustainability. This requires investment in infrastructural development, local population education, and destination advertising in both domestic and international markets. This study aims to investigate how agritourism may be efficiently incorporated into the overall tourism system, with a focus on three important segments: products, services, and promotion. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to study existing practices and identify difficulties in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s agritourism. More research on the demands of the target group, the economic impact of agritourism, and the sustainability of implemented techniques is recommended. Understanding market dynamics and consumer behaviour can aid in the development of strategies to assist the growth of agritourism. Integrating agritourism into a closed system of product and service offers has the potential to considerably boost the competitiveness of the sector. Investing in infrastructure, education, and coordinated promotion are critical elements to realise the full potential of agritourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina. © TÜBİTAK.","Agritourism; economic growth; management; management of tourism potential","Agribusiness; Agriculture; Competition; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; History; International trade; Investments; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Tourism; Agritourism; Bosnia and herzegovina; Economic growths; Environmental preservation; Fruit harvesting; Management of tourism potential; Natural beauty; Potential benefits; Product preservation; Rural regions; Consumer behavior; competitiveness; economic development; economic growth; sustainability; tourism economics; tourism management; tourist destination; Bosnia and Herzegovina","","","","","European Commission, EU; Federalno Ministarstvo Obrazovanja i Nauke; European Regional Development Fund, EFRE","Funding text 1: This paper is part of a scientific research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Science for the year 2023, entitled \u201CRural tourism in the Function of Local Economic Development in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u201D; Funding text 2: The European Community (EC) (2002) emphases the economic contribution of this type of tourism, particularly in terms of rural workforce employment, development opportunities for areas with difficult community management, and ensuring the preservation of their natural and cultural heritage.

Understanding this sector is important for policymakers, researchers, agricultural service providers, and others seeking to support farm viability and rural entrepreneurship. However, in the U.S., this support is hampered by the lack of a clear definition and consistent, comprehensive means for measuring the agritourism sector. The best available data for the U.S. are from the quinquennial U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA NASS)’s Census of Agriculture. However, the two questions used by the Census of Agriculture that relate to agritourism are worded in ways that limit a comprehensive understanding of the size and scope of the sector. To illustrate the limitations, we highlight cases from two U.S. states (Texas and Vermont), where different forms of agritourism are present. One such form, hunting, is included in the USDA’s economic assessments of agritourism; another, pick-your-own berries, is not. Along with tastings and purchases of locally grown products, this falls in the category of direct sales. The discrepancy can result in misrepresentation and misinterpretation of the data in analyses and subsequent publications with distorted policy recommendations related to agritourism. We discuss these cases alongside recommendations on how to more accurately measure, and support, agritourism development in the U.S. © 2024 by the Authors.","agricultural policy; agritourism; census of agriculture; definitions; direct sales; rural tourism; U.S. Department of Agriculture","","","","","","U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA; Pennsylvania State University, PSU; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA, (2020-68006-31683, 2021-51150-34733); National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) under projects # 2020-68006-31683 and #2021-51150-34733 and by the Pennsylvania State University and NIFA Multistate/Regional Research Appropriations under project #NE2249.

The negative effects are felt both at the individual level (household budget) and at the society level, and they are, as a rule, difficult to combat. From the existing quantitative and qualitative analyses, it was observed that food waste at household level represents over 50% of its total volume, even if food waste is produced throughout the supply chain. It is also noted that some economic sectors, by the nature of their activities, have a greater predilection to waste food. This study carried out on agro-tourist guesthouses in the mountainous area of Romania shows that, at their level, food waste has reduced. This is due to the household spirit and the ethical and spiritual values passed down from generation to generation, reflecting consumers’ affection and respect to Romania's mountains. Solutions aimed at reducing waste generation vary, encompassing everything from raising awareness about it to re-evaluating practices, advocating for good habits, implementing innovative packaging, and more. In light of this, this article seeks to enhance understanding of food waste and to pinpoint viable strategies for addressing it. Furthermore, it endeavors to estimate the volume of food waste in mountainous region of Romania, particularly within tourist establishments. Findings reveal that the highest levels of waste occur in mountain hotels, closely followed by agro-tourism guesthouses. Thus, this article provides a concise overview of food waste in mountainous areas and underscores the importance of initiatives aimed at its direct or indirect reduction. © 2024 by author(s).","Agritourism; Food behaviour; Food waste; Mountain area; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","Econometrica, (1954); A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning, (2017); Short Food Supply Chains for Promoting Local Food on Local Markets, (2020); Campoy-Muñoz, Pilar, Economic impact assessment of food waste reduction on European countries through social accounting matrices, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 122, pp. 202-209, (2017); Corrado, Sara, Food waste accounting along global and European food supply chains: State of the art and outlook, Waste Management, 79, pp. 120-131, (2018); De Laurentiis, Valeria, No time to waste: assessing the performance of food waste prevention actions, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 161, (2020); Duizer, Lisa M., Requirements for packaging from an ageing consumer's perspective, Packaging Technology and Science, 22, 4, pp. 187-197, (2009); From Farm to Kitchen the Environmental Impacts of U S Food Waste, (2021); Success Stories on Composting and Separate Collection, (2000); Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste Recommendations for Action in Food Waste Prevention, (2019)","D.

However, they also play a crucial role in providing economic opportunities for rural communities and are regarded as a center for rural economy. Rural areas often face challenges such as depopulation due to limited access to public services, inadequate infrastructure, geographical remoteness, economic hardships, educational barriers, and other factors. Thus, this study aims to investigate the profitability of RRs and owners' motivations for agritourism development, as profitability and business expansion are typically positively correlated. Data from 105 samples collected in rural Nepal in 2022 and 2023 were analyzed using Tobit and Ordered Logit regression models, respectively. The study conceptualizes and confirms various contributors to RR profitability, including factors related to the supply side, demand appeal, and those influenced by pandemic-related factors. Additionally, we explored how owners' motivations for agritourism are influenced by the restaurant's characteristics, quality-related factors, and other attributes. Policymakers need to support RR owners in developing agritourism initiatives and contribute to quality control through effective enforcement of consumer laws by a responsible and robust quality control team. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","agriculture; destination; developing countries; development; farm tourism; farmers; innovation; motivation; quantitative","agriculture; developing world; innovation; profitability; rural economy; smallholder; tourism development; tourist destination; Nepal","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (22K18103, JP18K11748, 18H03965); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","This study was funded by the Japan Society for Promotion of Sciences (JSPS) Kakenhi nos. {22K18103 (KB), JP18K11748 (TT), and 18H03965 (YO)}.","Adkins, Cheryl L., The Relationship between Owner Characteristics, Company Size, and the Work-Family Culture and Policies of Women-Owned Businesses, Journal of Small Business Management, 51, 2, pp. 196-214, (2013); Agius, Karl, The dependency-autonomy paradox: A core-periphery analysis of tourism development in Mediterranean archipelagos, International Journal of Tourism Research, 25, 5, pp. 506-516, (2023); Journal of Marketing, (1994); Aoki, Misa, Motivations for organic farming in tourist regions: A case study in Nepal, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 16, 1, pp. 181-193, (2014); Arru, Brunella, Economic performance of agritourism: an analysis of farms located in a less favoured area in Italy, Agricultural and Food Economics, 9, 1, (2021); Avci, Umut, Strategic orientation and performance of tourism firms: Evidence from a developing country, Tourism Management, 32, 1, pp. 147-157, (2011); Banerjee, Tannista, A county-level study of the effects of state-mandated COVID-19 lockdowns on urban and rural restaurant visits using consumers’ cell phone geo-location data, Journal of Public Health (Germany), 31, 2, pp. 249-258, (2023); Barbieri, Carla E., The role of the firm and owner characteristics on the performance of agritourism farms, Sociologia Ruralis, 48, 2, pp. 166-183, (2008); Barbieri, Carla E., Agritourism Advances around the Globe: A Commentary from the Editors, Open Agriculture, 4, 1, pp. 712-714, (2019); Bhatta, Kumar, Determinant Factors of Farmers' Willingness to Start Agritourism in Rural Nepal, Open Agriculture, 4, 1, pp. 431-445, (2019)","K.

We analyze both trend and seasonal components for agritouristic boarding houses, conventional boarding houses, hotels, and overall arrivals in 41 Romanian counties by using the Season-Trend decomposition using the LOESS method previously used in forecasting. Our findings suggest that there is a moderate positive relation between trend and seasonality in agritouristic boarding houses, a situation that is not shared with other types of accommodation units studied. While at a country-wide level the seasonal character of agritourism is not significantly different from other types of accommodations studied, in some counties located in south-east Romania, the seasonality exhibited by agritourism is significantly lower. Agritourism seasonal patterns exhibit spatial correlation features, indicating that underlying natural and anthropic causes exert more influence than in the case of other types of accommodations. These findings may be used to shape public policy and entrepreneur behavior in agritourism and rural tourism, domains where farm income diversification is instrumental to surviving events such as crop failures, price changes, and consumer behavior. © 2024 by the authors.","agritourism; seasonality in agritourism; STL decomposition; sustainable development; tourism seasonality; trend and seasonality in tourism","","","","","","","The publication of this paper was made possible by the funds of the University of Life Sciences “King Mihai I” from Timişoara and the Research Institute for Biosecurity and Bioengineering in Timisoara.","Seasonality in Tourism, (2001); Hartmann, Rudi, Tourism, seasonality and social change, Leisure Studies, 5, 1, pp. 25-33, (1986); Journal of Travel Research, (1991); Rom Stat Rev, (2019); Touristic Time Series; Zvaigzne, Anda, Tourism seasonality: the causes and effects, Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes, 14, 5, pp. 421-430, (2022); Alshuqaiqi, Ahmad, Causes and implication of seasonality in tourism, Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems, 11, 4 Special Issue, pp. 1480-1486, (2019); Sætórsdóttir, Anna Dóra, Senses by seasons: Tourists' perceptions depending on seasonality in popular nature destinations in Iceland, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 11, (2019); Dzhusov, Oleksii, The application features of seasonalcyclic patterns in international financial markets, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, 23, 5, pp. 1-10, (2019); Lisovski, Simeon, Defining the degree of seasonality and its significance for future research, Integrative and Comparative Biology, 57, 5, pp. 934-942, (2017)","C.A.

Agritourism, as an activity that values everything that is related to the agricultural heritage and that enables direct contact between visitor and farmer, contributes to positioning and strengthening the local agrifood product in tourist destination areas and becomes another link in the production chains, promoting direct sales and the short distribution circuit of the products. This research aims to measure the presence of the local agrifood product in the context of agritourism developed in the Western Catalan Pyrenees (Spain). To do this, it analyses the presence of the local product and the ways used to incorporate it into the travel experience. It explores (through interviews) the opinions of the owners of agritourism farms/businesses in relation to the repercussions of the producer–consumer connection through food. To reach this goal, secondary sources are reviewed—bibliographical, statistics, and web pages—and a total of 26 interviews are carried out. In terms of the results, we highlight that in the Western Catalan Pyrenees, about 70% of agritourism accommodations include local products in their offer. Additionally, the professional project is strengthened by including the agrifood product in the offer’s structure through catering and/or direct sale, generating positive dynamics among the rest of the producers in the area. However, only a small percentage of agritourism accommodations fully diversify their project with the production, consumption, and distribution of their own and local food. A total of four different profiles of agritourism are identified regarding agrifood products. © 2023 by the authors.","agricultural activities; agritourism; local agrifood products; proprietor; Pyrenees; Spain; tourism","carbon footprint; food product; global change; heritage tourism; production system; tourism; tourist destination; Pyrenees","","","","","Generalitat de Catalunya; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","Funding text 1: This contribution has been made within the framework of the strategic project aimed at the ecological and digital transition with reference TED2021-132384B-I00 of the State Plan for Scientific, Technical, and Innovation Research 2021–2023 (financed by the MCIN/AEI//10.13039/501100011033 and by the European Union NEXTGENERATIONEU/PRTR); and within the framework of the Consolidated Research Group Territory, Tourism and Climate Change of the Generalitat de Catalunya.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the State Plan for Scientific, Technical, and Innovation Research 2021–2023 (financed by the MCIN/AEI//10.13039/501100011033 and by the European Union NEXTGENERATIONEU/PRTR).","Bentham, James, Multidimensional characterization of global food supply from 1961 to 2013, Nature Food, 1, 1, pp. 70-75, (2020); Routledge International Handbook of Globalization Studies, (2010); Wang, Xiang, Trade for Food Security: The Stability of Global Agricultural Trade Networks, Foods, 12, 2, (2023); Investigaciones Geograficas, (2005); Economie Et Statistique, (2005); Debate Agrario Analisis Y Altern, (2022); Proposed CAP Strategic Plans and Commission Observations Summary Overview for 27 Member States; Estrategia Nacional Frente Al Reto Demografico, (2019); Programa De Desenvolupament Rural, (2023); Sobira 20 30 Estrategia De Futur, (2021)","M.

The aim of the present study is to verify the function of logotypes of selected agritourism establishments, especially in view of the rationale for placing them on home pages of websites, and the marketing function they fulfill. Homepages (the main web pages) of websites of 10 agritourism farms with the dimensions of 1,245 × 570 pixels (and 24 -bit color depth) were analyzed. The study involved 170 respondents (n = 170), whose task was to indicate a single element they perceive as positive, negative, and one that in their opinion best serves the promotional goal in each of the 10 homepages. Statistical analyses were performed using the R-CRAN software version 4.0.2. The study confirmed that there are both differences and similarities in the responses regarding logotypes of the agritourism farms studied. The perception of the logotype depends strongly on the education level and age of respondents. The analyses also confirmed that there is no linear relationship between the size of the logo and the frequency at which it is indicated as a promotional element. The use of a detailed factor analysis of logotypes (with the use of the click-tracking technique) on the websites of agritourism farms is an innovative approach and allows for a relatively comprehensive assessment of the perception of logotypes by potential consumers of offers available on the market. © The Author(s) 2023.","agritourism farms; logotype; marketing communication; perception; websites","","","","","","","","Ali, Faizan, Hotel website quality, perceived flow, customer satisfaction and purchase intention, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology, 7, 2, pp. 213-228, (2016); Al Shraah, Ata E.M., The impact of quality management practices on knowledge management processes: a study of a social security corporation in Jordan, TQM Journal, 34, 4, pp. 605-626, (2022); Strategie Marki Brand Strategies, (2002); Baek, Tae Hyun, The differential roles of brand credibility and brand prestige in consumer brand choice, Psychology and Marketing, 27, 7, pp. 662-678, (2010); Bai, Billy, The impact of website quality on customer satisfaction and purchase intentions: Evidence from Chinese online visitors, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 27, 3, pp. 391-402, (2008); Brand Equity and Advertising, (1993); J R Stat Soc B, (1995); Creating Powerful Brands, (1998); Choi, Dorothy K.Y., A model of online trust for travel products, International Journal of Services Technology and Management, 15, 1-2, pp. 132-146, (2011); Droulers, Olivier, Heraldry and brand logotypes: 800 years of color combinations, Journal of Historical Research in Marketing, 8, 4, pp. 507-523, (2016)","G.

Lots of TFPs are derived from underutilised plant species, which are generally undervalued in economic terms. The aim of the study was to analyse tourists’ familiarity with both conventional (i.e., wider known and used) and underutilised Cambodian TFPs. A total of 1271 international tourists were interviewed in the country’s three most visited regions. A pairwise matrix was used to document tourists’ preferences, χ2 test to determine associations between respondents’ preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, a bivariate probit model to examine factors influencing these attitudes, and an ordered probit model to analyse factors influencing willingness-to-pay for TFPs. A total of 923 respondents (72.6%) were familiar with at least one TFP. Kampot pepper, palm sugar and Rumduol rice were the best-known conventional TFPs, while Maprang, Kramsang and Ma-om were the better-known underutilised TFPs. Willingness-to-buy a TFP increased with prior knowledge of and familiarity with TFPs, education, religion and available budget. Low awareness, a short stay in Cambodia and possible health problems associated with their use were the main barriers to trying a TFP. Greater awareness, better organised distribution, improved packaging and labelling will be needed to increase TFP success among tourists, especially of those defined as underutilised. © 2023 by the authors.","agrotourism; Cambodia; consumer behaviour; neglected and underutilised species (NUS); rural development; willingness-to-pay","","","","","","(22/2017/10); (20223102, 20223113, 20223114); Česká Zemědělská Univerzita v Praze; Royal University of Agriculture, RUA","The study was financed through the project Support of enhancing science and research at the Royal University of Agriculture finance by the Czech Development Agency (No. 22/2017/10), and by the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (IGA FTZ, Projects No. 20223102, 20223113 and 20223114).","Travel Industry, (1997); Sabbe, Sara, Consumer liking of fruit juices with different açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) concentrations, Journal of Food Science, 74, 5, pp. S171-S176, (2009); Scott, David G., Back to the future: The affective power of food in reconstructing a tourist imaginary, pp. 143-156, (2015); undefined; Hall, C.

We gauge tourists’ ideology of locavorism through the lens of agritourism in India as we found it crucial to highlight and enhance local foods as an addition to the tourists’ palate. A pre- and post-survey was conducted using repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to empirically assess 8 Agritourism farms’ tourists’ behaviour towards locavorism. Data was collected among tourists by using a self-report questionnaire during two phases (check-in and check-out; n = 344). Findings underscore that tourists’ intention to buy local food increases considerably after experiencing Agritourism. This study is the first of its kind to understand the perception of tourists towards India’s ethnic cuisine, its role in augmenting tourist experience, and in figuring out better ways to sustain local foods. The impact that Agritourism has on tourists’ behaviour towards locavorism and its continuing effects on the local economy needs to be studied by researchers. Future research can extend the concept of locavorism to service providers by understanding their perception of producing and marketing sustainable local foods. © 2022 The Author(s).

Despite this growth, there is no shared understanding of agritourism, which is problematic because it creates confusion and diminishes its appeal among consumers, thereby impeding communication and collaboration between stakeholders. Agritourism activities can be carried out on a microscale in rural areas by families and agricultural practitioners or on a large scale by hotels, restaurants, and catering firms. Despite many developing countries’ agricultural potential, agritourism has not been inserted into development plans in these countries. Only agritourism in small accommodation enterprises is carried out on a microscale by rural families. This study seeks to test the relationship between the positive impacts of peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation and agritourism performance, with the mediating effects of support for P2P accommodations and organizational citizenship behavior towards P2P accommodations. The data were derived from 300 Airbnb consumers and hosts of agritourism accommodations in the eastern province of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The results of “Structural Equation Modeling” (SEM) via the “Partial least squares” (PLS) showed a positive direct relationship between peer-to-peer accommodation and agritourism performance with a significant mediating role of Organizational Citizenship Behavior and a positive moderating role of information on Agritourism destinations.

Taiwan’s Huatung area organic agricultural tourism is an environmentally friendly type of tourism that has emerged in recent years, and more and more tourists are engaged in agricultural tourism. Developing the landscape resources of organic agricultural tourists to make them stand out and attract more tourists is not an easy task. This research establishes a comprehensive model to explore how the consumer landscape (LAN) affects place attachment (PAT), with attention recovery theory (ART) as a mediating variable. A quantitative questionnaire survey was conducted, and the LISREL was used as an analysis tool to verify the relationship between variables. The result shows that attention restoration substantially influences PAT, and the LAN positively affects attention restoration and PAT. In addition, this research found that the impact of LAN on PAT through attention recovery was more significant than that of LAN directly, which verified that attention recovery was an important mediating variable. The findings not only break through the theoretical gap but also provide practical suggestions for developing organic agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.","agricultural tourism; attention restoration; attention restoration theory (ART); consumer landscape (LAN); place attachment (PAT)","","","","","","","","Barbieri, Carla E., Agritourism research: a perspective article, Tourism Review, 75, 1, pp. 149-152, (2020); J Outdoor Recreat Study, (2020); Shen, Chingcheng, Rural tourism and environmental sustainability—a study on a model for assessing the developmental potential of organic agritourism, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 22, pp. 1-16, (2020); Gil-Arroyo, Claudia, Defining agritourism: A comparative study of stakeholders' perceptions in Missouri and North Carolina, Tourism Management, 37, pp. 39-47, (2013); Barbieri, Carla E., Assessing the sustainability of agritourism in the US: A comparison between agritourism and other farm entrepreneurial ventures, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 21, 2, pp. 252-270, (2013); Area of Organic Planting Land, (2021); Xue, Linlin, The Sustainable Development of Organic Agriculture: The Role of Wellness Tourism and Environmental Restorative Perception, Agriculture (Switzerland), 12, 2, (2022); Gobster, Paul H., The shared landscape: What does aesthetics have to do with ecology?, Landscape Ecology, 22, 7, pp. 959-972, (2007); Ryan, Robert L., Preserving rural character in New England: Local residents' perceptions of alternative residential development, Landscape and Urban Planning, 61, 1, pp. 19-35, (2002); Vogt, Christine A., Natural resources and open space in the residential decision process: A study of recent movers to fringe counties in southeast Michigan, Landscape and Urban Planning, 69, 2-3, pp. 255-269, (2004)","J.P.

It proposes an integrative model by adding two variables, i.e., environmental benefits and the human-nature coordination concept, to the TPB. The study employs a questionnaire survey method and a sample of 640, which was statistically analysed through structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that the “environmental values-attitudes-behavioural intentions” framework has scientific applicability in agritourism. Environmental values, measured through the variables environmental benefits and the human-nature coordination concept, are positively correlated directly or indirectly with agritourism consumption intentions, while attitudes and subjective norms serve as mediators. However, the mediating effect of perceived behavioural control is not statistically significant, indicating making efforts to influence attitudes and subjective norms is more useful for and effective in stimulating the public’s intentions towards agritourism. As this study tests the hypotheses with empirical data, it provides practical implications for policy-makers and programme managers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agritourism; Consumer intentions; Environmental values; Theory of planned behaviour","agriculture; consumption behavior; ecotourism; environmental values; questionnaire survey","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (19YJA790101)","This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Sciences project of Ministry of Education, P.R.C.

The significant disruptions caused by Covid-19 have called international attention to food security and sparked conversations about how to better support food production and trade. Our paper contributes to a small but growing literature on the impacts and responses of agroecological farmers to Covid-19 in Costa Rica. Specifically, we interviewed 30 agroecological farmers about (1) livelihood disruptions during Covid-19, (2) the areas of food production and sales most affected during this pandemic, and (3) how farmers and consumers are adapting during this crisis. Our findings reveal multiple impacts on agroecological farmers including: economic hardships of lower incomes and inability to pay loans, changes in purchasing and consumption patterns, market disruptions, changes in sales, a decrease in agrotourism, and a shortage of farmworkers. Furthermore, we also report the following farmer adaptation strategies: (1) minimizing distance with consumers to facilitate direct delivery, (2) establishing e-commerce platforms. Based on our findings, we recommend the following: (1) building farmer networks for knowledge sharing, (2) increasing technological support for farmers, and (3) providing government support to ensure that such crises do not increase unemployment among farmers and exacerbate food insecurity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agroecology; e-commerce; Food distribution; Food security; Local food; Resilience","","","","","","","We would like to thank the farmer participants that continue to produce and deliver our food, despite the challenges and uncertainties compounded by Covid-19.","Blay-Palmer, Alison D., Post COVID 19 and food pathways to sustainable transformation, Agriculture and Human Values, 37, 3, pp. 517-519, (2020); Ceballos, Francisco, Impacts of a national lockdown on smallholder farmers’ income and food security: Empirical evidence from two states in India, World Development, 136, (2020); Chi Ffoleau, Yuna, Sustainable food supply chains: Is shortening the answer? a literature review for a research and innovation agenda, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 23, pp. 1-21, (2020); Knowledge Management for Development Journal, (2010); Sustainable Rural Development Sustainable Livelihoods and the Community Capitals Framework, (2013); Harris, Jody, Food system disruption: initial livelihood and dietary effects of COVID-19 on vegetable producers in India, Food Security, 12, 4, pp. 841-851, (2020); Covid 19 and Global Food Security, (2020); Kumar, Pavan, Multi-level impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on agricultural systems in India: The case of Uttar Pradesh, Agricultural Systems, 187, (2021); Michel-Villarreal, Rosario, Resilience and digitalization in short food supply chains: A case study approach, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Costa Rican Agriculture Reinvents Itself in the Face of the Covid 19, (2020)","M.

The need for food manufacturers to understand consumers and their motivation in choosing a product has increased. This research aims to analyze the relevance and applicability of the transparent production concept in the conditions of the Russian Federation and identify the most significant problems for educational work. The research tasks are as follows: (1) comparing preferences of consumers buying meat in Russia and the USA; (2) studying the differences in the perception of visual information and attitudes towards industrial production depending on the level of competence; (3) analyzing key aspects of pork production that are of the greatest interest to consumers; and (4) analyzing existing tools for communicating with consumers. The following research methods were used to solve the tasks set: (1) theoretical (analysis, synthesis, generalization, and comparison of information on the research problem); (2) empirical (questioning, conversation, and content analysis); and (3) statistical (graphical and tabular interpretations of research data). The paper compares new data on the differences in preferences of consumers buying meat. Within the transparent production concept, the nine most relevant areas for educational work aimed at increasing mutual understanding between consumers and producers of meat products are identified. The analysis has shown that depending on the experience and knowledge of the biological characteristics of pigs, there is a fundamental difference in the assessment of animal welfare in specific production conditions. The following areas are identified as the most relevant for educational work: (1) environmental protection measures; (2) measures to reduce odors; (3) outdoor and indoor production; (4) fixed or free housing of gestating sows; (5) castration, cutting tails, and grinding fangs; (6) practice of using antibiotics; (7) practice of using growth stimulants; (8) nature of rapid growth and reaching slaughter condition; and (9) animal welfare. As the main tools for information communication with consumers, it is proposed to more actively using social networks, company websites on the Internet, television and radio, press publications, and agritourism, as well as agroclasses and agrohours at schools. © 2022, Science and Innovation Center Publishing House.

Research carried out shows there have been significant changes compared to pre-COVID levels in the way consumers plan their food purchases. Based on the results of empirical data and emerging information such as ad hoc reports and analysis of academic literature, the authors aim to understand the effect of COVID-19 on agricultural and extra-agricultural activities in diversified Italian farms. More specifically, due to their importance at a national level, the focus of the analysis is represented by the agritourism, how they have reacted to the challenges posed by the pandemic, and towards which evolutionary lines they are orienting themselves to face the next future challenges. Empirical data for this study were collected through the use of a questionnaire survey, managed by the research team. The survey, conducted online during summer 2021, was designed by using a random stratified sampling for which the farms are characterized by a certain heterogeneity of the activities carried out (i.e., hospitality, processing of products, renewable energy production, etc.). The research activity covered the entire Italian territory and the number of responding farms with agritourism activities is equal to 77 (a 17.5% response rate). The results highlight the importance of farm with agritourism activities in dealing with COVID-19 crisis and policy implications in terms of support for the competitiveness of farms, exchange of knowledge, and innovations among farmers that should be taken into consideration to target the next rural development policy at the EU, the national and regional level. At the same time, the sample reaction methods to the pandemic and the changing business strategies highlight a certain resilience of Italian farms with agritourism activities, thus showing their ability to adapt. © 2022 by the authors.","agritourism; COVID-19 crisis; farm diversification; resilience; sustainable local food system","agriculture; COVID-19; farm; food production; sustainability; tourism development; Italy","","","","","","This research received funding from the Italian Network for Rural Development 2014–2020, Fiche 2.1 “Eccellenze rurali”, co-financed by European agricultural fund for rural development.

The surplus of consumer visits is IDR. 12,670, and the individual consumer surplus visits are IDR.33. The economic value generated for one year is IDR. 237,600. The factors that influence the demand are income, distance, and time to know the location. At the same time, the factors that do not affect the market are travel cost, education, number of dependents in the family, gender, and age of visitors. © 2022 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

Given that, we aim to examine the differences between the countries belonging to the former USSR and the satellite countries of the former USSR. (2) Methods: For the realisation of the intended objective, we analysed studies of the literature on the subject, in terms of the theoretical treatment of the entrepreneurial eco-system in the field of agritourism, and current legal acts. Our own observations from stays in the regions in question were also used, along with statistical methods concerning the density of the transport network, comparative analysis of historical and political conditions, and SWOT analysis. (3) Results: Substantial differences were found between the components of the agritourism entrepreneurship ecosystem in Poland and Kazakhstan, primarily related to the level of transport infrastructure density (satisfactory in West Pomeranian Voivodeship, insufficient in North Kazakhstan), tradition of individual farming (well established in Poland, poorly present in Kazakhstan), support for agritourism development by central and local authorities (relatively high in Poland, incidental and with a short history in Kazakhstan), and finally, differences in the target group of agritourism service recipients (stable in Poland, undefined in Kazakhstan). (4) Conclusions: The research leads to the conclusion of the heterogeneity of the determinants of the development of the agritourism entrepreneurship ecosystem in countries collectively defined as post-communist. There are clearly different challenges and facilitations resulting not so much from the past political system as from the ethnichistorical considerations, the position of agriculture in the economy, and the degree and effectiveness of the involvement of administrative authorities in the development of agritourism. The study leads to a recommendation on the need for more efficient targeting of agritourism consumers abroad. © 2021 by the authors.

Agritourism presents a blend of natural beauty, agricultural production activities, and the culture of agricultural communities that are well managed so that they have an attractive appeal to visitors. The purpose of this study is to examine the level of visitor satisfaction of Kampung Flory agritourism. Besides, the study also attempts to investigate the factors related to visitor satisfaction. One hundred visitors of the agritourism were used as a sample selected by accidental sampling. The level of visitor satisfaction was measured by the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) index. The Spearman rank analysis is used to determine the factors related to visitor satisfaction. The research location is determined purposively, in the Kampung Flory agritourism. Results from the IPA analysis show that the overall visitor satisfaction index achieved by Kampung Flory Agritourism is 80.24%. The results suggest that Kampung Flory Agritourism is in a position to satisfy consumers. Meanwhile, results from Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed that product quality, service quality, emotional, cost and convenience are correlate with consumer satisfaction.

Despite some differences mainly due to specific national developments on the topic, today there is a substantial convergence in the belief that the term agroecology reconciles three dimensions: scientific discipline, social movement, cultural practice. Beyond the deep-rooted French experience, at the level of the European Union (EU) there is no clear strategy for agroecological practices and action plans. In the Italian case, a first step forward, especially in terms of initiatives, was taken following the universal exhibition “EXPO 2015 Milan” while with respect to the promotion of agroecological practices, some positive feedback is ascribable to the experience of the Bio-districts. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the model adopted by the Italian multifunctional farms can be considered precursory with respect to the approach that, from a theoretical point of view, identifies agroecology. The Italian system on farms diversification would seem to show it has somehow anticipated the new European Green Deal strategy for the next ten years due to the simultaneous presence of key elements that concern not only agricultural practice but also ethical and social aspects by involving farmers and communities that insist on the territory. Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategies recognize a new and important role for the agriculture and agri-food sectors and to invite farmers to engage consumers’ interest. The study also considers some characteristics of the farmers, such as the level of education and the economic sector in which they were employed before devoting themselves to the agritourism business but also the ability to develop multi-actor and multi-level networks. The analysis of these determinants would allow them to place different professional skills at the service of the primary sector that tend to positively influence the organization and farm performance. At the same time, the farmers’ skills are influenced by different sectors of activity such as participation in research projects or even in local initiatives with public and private actors. This allows the agroecological approach to be put into practice in a conscious (or unconscious) way. © 2021 by the authors.

Purpose of the paper: This study investigates whether the presence of green practices or a green image in the accommodation sector influences customer satisfaction and eWOM and whether this differs between different accommodation categories. Methodology: The TripAdvisor reviews of 1701 Italian hospitality business were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Accommodation facilities with green practices present high scores in guest satisfaction and eWOM, particularly those with a green image. The differences in customer satisfaction between accommodation types is smaller for businesses with a green image. B&Bs, agritourism facilities, and other accommodation facilities, even those without a green image, can rely on green practices to increase customer satisfaction and eWOM. Research limitations: We considered the use of green features in the name of the accommodation facility as a proxy for sustainability alignment. Customer satisfaction could be affected by other variables. The sub-sample of “green name” companies is limited. The size and age of the accommodation facility could impact the number of reviews. Practicalimplications: Our results provide valuable insights into the determinants of customer satisfaction and intention to review a green practice and suggest the need to communicate a green orientation. Originality of the study: Our study extends the investigation to different accommodation types; considers the green image of the accommodation facilities rather than green certification; compares customer satisfaction and eWOM with or without a green image by accommodation type. © 2021 Fondazione Cueim.

Prior research on agritourism operator motivations largely focuses on economic goals and benefits, while acknowledging the strong influence of non-economic factors. However, more research is needed to better understand the nuances and breadth of noneconomic motivations underlying agritourism operator decisions. In addition, research on U.S. agritourism tends to be at the state level, which raises questions about overall national trends and interstudy comparability. To address these gaps, we analyzed transcripts from semistructured interviews with small-and medium-sized farm owners engaged in agritourism from five states across the U.S. We examined the results through the theoretical lens of Allport’s “contact hypothesis” in order to further understand how agritourism helps operators meet stated goals. Our results suggest that consistent with previous literature, nonmonetary motivations are high priorities for farmers engaged in agritourism. In particular, motivations related to community engagement/ leadership and quality-oflife emerged as forceful and reoccurring themes. We found that although Allport’s contact hypothesis holds some important explanatory power for understanding agritourism operators’ communityrelated goals—including reducing prejudice and increasing understanding between farmers and consumers in relation to agriculture—increased intergroup contact also has potential to create new conflicts between farmers and neighbors related to tourism. These findings have important implications for future research as well as for policies and programs aimed at supporting agritourism. © 2021 by the Authors.

However, if agro-tourism is managed by the community, can it give satisfaction to the visitors? This study aims to determine the level of customer satisfaction by Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) and to investigate what marketing mix attributes should be improved by IPA-Kano integration analysis. The research method used was a quantitative research on community-based Salak (Salacca zalacca) Agro-tourism in each category of tourism village, namely ’growing’, ‘developing’ and ‘independent’ tourism village categories. The measurement of visitor satisfaction used the marketing mix attributes of 7Ps (price, place, product, promotion, process, people and physical evidence). Based on the results of CSI, the services provided by the community-based salak agro-tourism manager are considered ‘Satisfied’ in the Growing and Developing agro-tourisms and ‘Very Satisfied’ in the Independent agro-tourism. Priority attributes that should be improved are attributes included in the ‘Fatal’ category. Priority attributes in ‘growing’ agro-tourism are the marketing activities (publicity), availability and cleanliness toilet. Priority attributes in ‘developing’ agro-tourism are marketing activities (promotion), availability and cleanliness of toilets. Priority attributes in ‘independent’ agro-tourism are availability and cleanliness of toilets. © 2020 Universitas Sebelas Maret.","agro-tourism development; consumer satisfaction; IPA-kano integration; marketing mix","","","","","","","","Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business, (2013); Bagi, Faqir Singh, Factors affecting farmer participation in agritourism, Agricultural and Resource Economics Review, 41, 2, pp. 189-199, (2012); Budiasa, I.

Increasing the distance between the producer and the consumer results not only in certain problems in maintaining profitability by small, local producers, but also in a threat to food safety. One way to counteract these adverse effects is to sell food through short supply chains. They shape the market in the direction of maintaining care for the sustainable development of all food production, but above all, maintaining and strengthening the production capacity ensuring the transparency of the high-quality food production process from an identifiable source of origin. The purpose of this article is to indicate the conditions on the side of both carp producers and consumers, conducive to building short supply chains, and determine whether they can be an effective alternative sales model in Polish conditions. The article focuses on the possibilities of developing short supply chains on the carp market in the Barycz Valley, concentrating the largest area of carp ponds in Europe. The research (surveys) included the five largest fishing farms and, on the recipient side, individual consumers and restaurants located in the Barycz Valley and Wroclaw, and agritourism facilities in the researched area. The obtained results confirmed that short supply chains in the area of Polish aquaculture are characterized by high implementation potential. However, it is necessary to modify the current sales model so that the producers' expectations regarding the sales volume and the obtained price are balanced with the expectations of consumers articulating the will to buy fish at a given time, place, and price. This, in turn, will ensure the high economic efficiency of fishing farms, and consumers will have access to a high-quality product. © 2020 by the authors.","Aquaculture; Milicz carp; Short food supply chains; Supply chain model","consumption behavior; cyprinid; demand analysis; food market; food production; food quality; food safety; profitability; supply chain management; sustainable development; Cyprinidae","","","","","Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu, UPWr; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (265287); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","The research is co-financed under the pro-development project B011/0010/20 from Wroc\u0142aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences.","Value Chain of Fish and Fishery Products Origin Functions and Application in Developed and Developing Country Markets, (2011); Short Supply Chains on the Example of the Milicz Carp, (2019); Marsden, Terry K., Food supply chain approaches: Exploring their role in rural development, Sociologia Ruralis, 40, 4, pp. 424-438, (2000); Official Journal of the European Union Regulation Eu no 1305 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on Support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development Eafrd and Repealing Council Regulation EC no 1698 2005, (2020); Official Journal of the European Union Commission Delegated Regulation Eu no 807 2014 of 11 March 2014 Supplementing Regulation Eu no 1305 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development Eafrd and Introducing Transitional Provisions, (2020); Local Agriculture and Short Food Supply Chains, (2020); Barriers and Opportunities for the Development of Klz Systems for the Needs of the Know and Eatsmartly Campaign, (2018); undefined, (2012); Food Security, (2016); Migliore, Giuseppina, Opening the black box of food quality in the short supply chain: Effects of conventions of quality on consumer choice, Food Quality and Preference, 39, pp. 141-146, (2015)","M.

Despite this, the availability of online reviews referring to agritourism resources is very rarely addressed in academic literature. This study investigates visitor satisfaction with farmhouses on the basis of online reviews available on the official websites of 397 farmhouses with educational farms associated with the Agritourism.it organization. Visitor satisfaction is important for successful destination marketing as it influences destination selection and the consumption of products and services. This study's findings provide insights for consumers and agritourism operators with the aim of matching customer expectations to the types of agritourism on offer in Italian municipalities. On the demand side, according to the overall satisfaction with the specific characteristics of farmhouses as expressed by 10,864 visitors, the results of a Principal Component Analysis showed that the activities and facilities present in the surrounding natural and cultural areas of the farmhouses are the attributes with the highest visitor satisfaction scores. In contrast, on the supply side, the results of a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed different groups of farmhouses characterized by ""homogenous"" features and by a ""homogenous"" heritage of natural and cultural resources. Assessing visitor satisfaction and feedback can help managers to improve their service performance. For this purpose, the findings of the study reveal that the economic and environmental sustainability, among the other motivations, has shown to play a crucial role in influencing visitors' frequency to learn about specific information concerning agriculture, the environment, and about issues regarding food, culture and the rural tradition. © 2020 by the authors.","Farmhouse; Hierarchical Cluster Analysis; Italian municipalities; Online review; Principal component analysis; Resources; Visitor satisfaction","farm; Internet; marketing; tourism; tourist destination; Italy","","","","","","","Baka, Vasiliki, The becoming of user-generated reviews: Looking at the past to understand the future of managing reputation in the travel sector, Tourism Management, 53, pp. 148-162, (2016); Berezina, Katerina, Understanding Satisfied and Dissatisfied Hotel Customers: Text Mining of Online Hotel Reviews, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, 25, 1, pp. 1-24, (2016); Gavilan, Diana, The influence of online ratings and reviews on hotel booking consideration, Tourism Management, 66, pp. 53-61, (2018); Guo, Yue, Mining meaning from online ratings and reviews: Tourist satisfaction analysis using latent dirichlet allocation, Tourism Management, 59, pp. 467-483, (2017); Radojević, Tijana, The effects of traveling for business on customer satisfaction with hotel services, Tourism Management, 67, pp. 326-341, (2018); Sparks, Beverley Ann, The impact of online reviews on hotel booking intentions and perception of trust, Tourism Management, 32, 6, pp. 1310-1323, (2011); Tan, Huimin, Evaluation nudge: Effect of evaluation mode of online customer reviews on consumers’ preferences, Tourism Management, 65, pp. 29-40, (2018); Yang, Yang, Electronic word of mouth and hotel performance: A meta-analysis, Tourism Management, 67, pp. 248-260, (2018); Zhang, Ye, Dimensions of lodging guest satisfaction among guests with mobility challenges: A mixed-method analysis of web-based texts, Tourism Management, 53, pp. 13-27, (2016); Daugherty, Terry, eWOM and the importance of capturing consumer attention within social media, Journal of Marketing Communications, 20, 1-2, pp. 82-102, (2014)","R.M.

Because of the humid subtropical climate and lack of suitable cultivars, yields are relatively low with a narrow harvest window compared to major strawberry producing countries. However, consumer demand for strawberries is strong in Taiwan. Over the last two decades, there were significant changes in Taiwan’s strawberry industry. From 1997 to 2017, production area, production volume, yield, farm gate price, and production value increased by 36% (369 vs. 500 ha), 100% (4444 vs. 8907 t), 48% (12.0 vs. 17.8 t/ha), 94% (66 vs. 127 NT$/kg), and 186% (0.79 vs. 2.27 million NT$/ha), respectively. Strawberries produced in 2017 were valued at 1.13 billion NT$ (35.7 million US$), which was the highest on record. Imports of strawberries also increased by 104% (562 vs. 933 t) from 2006 to 2017. The industry’s rapid growth has been supported by advanced production technologies, improved crop management practices, breeding programs, and local marketing efforts. Taiwanese consumers are brand-conscious and demand for high-quality food products. Agritourism has recently become very popular in the strawberry production areas. Because of strong consumer demand and unique market opportunities, Taiwan’s strawberry industry has significant growth potential, particularly in U-pick and organic farming. This paper provides an overview of Taiwan’s strawberry industry and discusses its challenges and opportunities. © 2020 The Author(s).

Indeed, one of the most important factors that drives visitors to choose an agritourism facility for their vacation is the pull of good food and wine. This manuscript examines visitors' evaluations of their time spent in Tuscan agritourism facilities with particular focus on the cuisine, the health benefits, and the social experience. The analysis is based on a representative sample of 1886 reviews posted by visitors from all over of the world on the websites of 60 agritourism facilities that operate in Tuscan municipalities. By exploring visitor evaluations, which consist of an overall rating of their agritourism experience and separate ratings for the cuisine, the physical environment, and the service, this paper expands the scope of previous studies into food and drink management development as a way of attracting new visitors, by providing additional information on the distinctive characteristics of the local cuisine on offer. Results indicate that visitors-above all families-prefer an agritourism facility that offers authentic local cuisine and beverages and also offers them the possibility of spending time outdoors in destinations with a rich culinary heritage. Visibility of the main attractive attributes of agritourism facilities and the local cuisine through websites is needed in order to drive consumers in their vacation choices and to allow these structures to consolidate their place in the food and drink market. © 2019 by the authors.","Food vacations; Motivational factors; Tobit regression; Visitors' typologies; Word-of-mouth","","","","","","","","Tourists Satisfaction Level at Religious Visit A Study of Brij Kshetra Ijar, (2017); Agriturismos with Educational Farms, (2018); Akdağ, Gurkan, Do tourists’ gastronomic experiences differ within the same geographical region?

This study provides a supply-side analysis on agritourism using Taiwan as a case study. Utilising a sample of 720,148 family farms from the 2010 agriculture census survey in Taiwan, we quantify the effects of engaging in the agritourism business on farm income, on farm succession, and on family members’ labour supply decisions between on-farm and off-farm work. An analytical framework that combines the doubly robustness regression model and semiparametric estimation is proposed to address the endogeneity bias. Results indicate that participation in agritourism increases farm income and family farm succession. Farms engaging in agritourism also have more family members working on the farm, and fewer family members working off-farm, compared to farms not engaging in agritourism. Although agritourism enterprises are developed to meet consumers’ demand for leisure, our results show that they also improve the economic welfare of farm households. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","agritourism; farm income; farm succession; labour supply","agroindustry; census; family farm; income; labor supply; quantitative analysis; tourism; Taiwan","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (105-2410-H-002-006)","","Choices, (2011); Altonji, Joseph G., Selection on observed and unobserved variables: Assessing the effectiveness of Catholic schools, Journal of Political Economy, 113, 1, pp. 151-184, (2005); Ammirato, Salvatore, The agritourism as a means of sustainable development for rural communities: A research from the field, International Journal of Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies, 8, 1, pp. 17-29, (2014); Bagi, Faqir Singh, Factors affecting farmer participation in agritourism, Agricultural and Resource Economics Review, 41, 2, pp. 189-199, (2012); Barbieri, Carla E., Assessing the sustainability of agritourism in the US: A comparison between agritourism and other farm entrepreneurial ventures, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 21, 2, pp. 252-270, (2013); An Activity Based Classification of Agritourists, (2014); Barbieri, Carla E., Why is diversification an attractive farm adjustment strategy?

As visualization turns out to be an efficient tool for transfer of acquired knowledge, understanding of the influence of visualization techniques on the process of knowledge sharing is a necessity. Objectives: The main objective of the paper is to deepen the understanding of the relation of visualization to other knowledge sharing paths. The supplementary goal is a discussion of constraints on visualization styles in relation to readability and efficiency. Methods/Approach: Due to the ambiguous nature of the problem, case analysis was selected as a research method. Two research papers have been selected for that. The first one focused on agrotourism, introduces a general use theoretical tool suitable for various purposes, such as consumer sentiment analysis. The second one evaluates possibilities of revealing an implicit organizational structure of an organization by means of visual analysis using interaction graphs. Results: Visualization is an important part of data analysis and knowledge transfer process. Hybrid visualization styles enhance information density but may decrease clarity. Conclusions: In order to maximise the role of visualization in a knowledg tranfer process, the special care must be devoted to clarity, the optimal level of details and information density in order to avoid obfuscation. © 2019 Janusz Opiła.","graphviz; Knowledge Transfer; Sentiment Forecasting; Visualization","","","","","","Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza im.

Due to its geographical position, rich history, and natural beauty, Sicily is a year-round attraction for large numbers of tourists from all over the world. In this respect, it is vital to invest in the local area, to try to maintain and increase the potential that the territory itself can offer. With this work, we consider the agritourism sector to specifically assess its potential interest for business people and consumers, both actual and potential. Indeed, if on one side modern tourism was born from a desire to visit faraway places, it is undeniable that tourists also want to discover local identities and to recover local traditions and products, as well as the most authentic socio-cultural expressions. An analysis of the agritourism sector of the Province of Palermo was carried out, analysing both the demand and the supply side. The data showed that the sector is developing strongly and is of interest to local entrepreneurs seeking to position themselves in the marketplace. © © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Agriculture; Authentic; Food economy; Growth; Local tradiction; Socio-cultural; Tourism","","","","","","","","Analisi Delle Tendenze E Strategie Per Lo Sviluppo Delle Attivita Agrituristiche, (2004); Aree Rurali E Configurazioni Turistiche Differenziazione E Sentieri Di Sviluppo in Toscana, (2011); Prospettive Di Sviluppo Per Le Aree Rurali Della Campania, (2004); Luoghi E Forme Del Turismo Rurale Evidenze Empiriche in Irpinia, (2010); Marketing Per L Impresa Agrituristica, (2006); Incentivi Agevolazioni E Semplificazioni Per L Impresa Agricola Dopo Il Decreto Competitivita, (2014); Towards Quality Coastal Tourism, (2000); Aree Rurali E Configurazioni Turistiche, (2011); Come Creare Valore Dal Territorio, (2011); L Impresa Agrituristica, (2009)","E.

Data were collected in Umbria region's (Italy) agritourism farms in 2014 by interviewing 160 tourists. Results from a discrete choice experiment reveal that the most important feature affecting the interviewees' propensity to pay a premium price to stay in an agritourism farm is the well-preserved traditional landscape (willingness to pay 32.32€/night for two people), followed by the availability of a swimming pool (willingness to pay 20.95€/ night for two people), the proximity to a historical village (willingness to pay 18.37€/night for two people) and, the location in a Natura 2000 SCI (willingness to pay 13.57€/night for two people). Furthermore, the results underline how the preservation of the traditional landscape and protection of the surrounding environment play a strategic role in developing agritourism and provide economic benefits to local communities. © The Authors. 2017.","Agritourism; Biodiversity; Discrete choice experiments; Italy; Natura 2000 sites; Traditional rural landscape","","","","","","","","Adhikari, Atanu, Differentiating Subjective and Objective Attributes of Experience Products to Estimate Willingness to Pay Price Premium, Journal of Travel Research, 54, 5, pp. 634-644, (2015); Italian Historical Rural Landscapes Cultural Values for the Environment and Rural Development, (2013); Albaladejo, Isabel P., Tourist preferences for rural house stays: Evidence from discrete choice modelling in Spain, Tourism Management, 30, 6, pp. 805-811, (2009); Antrop, Marc, Why landscapes of the past are important for the future, Landscape and Urban Planning, 70, 1-2, pp. 21-34, (2005); Apostolakis, Alexandros, A choice modeling application for Greek heritage attractions, Journal of Travel Research, 43, 3, pp. 309-318, (2005); Barbieri, Carla E., The role of the firm and owner characteristics on the performance of agritourism farms, Sociologia Ruralis, 48, 2, pp. 166-183, (2008); undefined, (2008); Barros, Carlos Pestana, Heterogeneity in destination choice: Tourism in Africa, Journal of Travel Research, 47, 2, pp. 235-246, (2008); Bastian, Olaf, The appreciation of nature and landscape by tourism service providers and visitors in the Ore Mountains (Germany), Landscape Online, 41, 1, pp. 1-23, (2015); Bel, Franҫois, Domestic demand for tourism in rural areas: Insights from summer stays in three French regions, Tourism Management, 46, pp. 562-570, (2014)","B.

Despite such growth, there is not a shared understanding of many aspects of the tourism development framework for all kinds of agricultural heritage sites. Given that meanings and characteristics are critical to determining the appeal of a particular activity among tourism consumers and because the development directions of AHST are essential for achieving heritage conservation goals, a study was conducted in 2014–2015 to assess stakeholder preferences for definitional phrases and their perceptions. This manuscript summarizes the characteristics of AHST in four aspects, taking agricultural heritage systems in China as examples: 1) synthesis of agritourism, cultural heritage tourism, and ecotourism; 2) annual variation of tourism attractions and activities; 3) the dominant role of artisan farmers; 4) the unique gastronomic experiences of traditional food. Finally, there are some objectives offered by this research from economic, environmental, cultural, social and political perspectives to build a framework of AHST according to its features and characteristics. Based on environmental and cultural objectives, with political and social support, through reaching the core objectives of economic development, AHST will be sustainable and agricultural heritage systems will be well conserved. This study carries important implications for the further applications of AHST. © 2016, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Agricultural Heritage Systems Tourism; Artisan farmers; Development framework; Tourism characteristics; Tourism perceptions","agricultural worker; cultural heritage; ecotourism; farming system; heritage tourism; perception; stakeholder; tourism development; tourist attraction; China","","","","","Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","The study is supported by Scientific Research Foundation for Youth Scholars, IGSNRR, CAS, entitled “Evaluation on the conservation and development of agricultural heritage systems in China”.

As such, and given the importance of wine and food tourism in recent years, there is a potential commitment to the development of olive tourism. Design - This paper aims to analyse the kind of the tourist for whom one of the reasons for travelling to a certain destination is to get to know the production of olive oil. Methodology - The methodology for conducting this research was based on fieldwork to learn about different aspects of tourists interested in learning about olive oil production. Approach - In this paper we present the results of fieldwork in Andalusia (Spain), the most important olive oil producing area in the world, to understand the relationship between olive oil and tourism. This paper also tries to create a profile of this kind of tourist. Findings - The results show the significant judgement that respondent tourists make of this agricultural activity, their satisfaction with the experience and also their relationship with rural activities and culture. Originality of the research - This paper is one of the first studies to be carried out in an important destination for olive tourism in Europe.","Agritourism; Andalusia; Culture; Destinations; Rural development","","","","","","","","Alebaki, Maria C., Segmenting the Greek wine tourism market using a motivational approach, New Medit, 9, 4, pp. 31-40, (2010); Duarte Alonso, Abel, Investigating differences between domestic and international winery visitors in New Zealand, International Journal of Wine Business Research, 19, 2, pp. 114-126, (2007); Duarte Alonso, Abel, Olives, hospitality and tourism: A Western Australian perspective, British Food Journal, 112, 1, pp. 55-68, (2010); Duarte Alonso, Abel, The development of olive tourism in Western Australia: A case study of an emerging tourism industry, International Journal of Tourism Research, 12, 6, pp. 696-708, (2010); Alonso, Abel Duarte, Food heritage down under: Olive growers as mediterranean ‘food ambassadors’, Journal of Heritage Tourism, 8, 2-3, pp. 158-171, (2013); Proyecto Oleoturismo Una Red Europea Para La Promocion De La Cultura Del Olivo, (2004); Turismo Desenvolvimento, (2014); Correia, Antónia H., First-time and repeat visitors to Cape Verde: The overall image, Tourism Economics, 14, 1, pp. 185-203, (2008); de Salvo, Paola, Territory, tourism and local products.

In the case of South Africa tourism is a priority sector for national economic development. The significance of research issues around tourism and LED is underlined by the 'developmental' mandate of local governments. Although tourism has received attention in a growing body of LED writings on South Africa issues around agritourism so far have been overlooked. Agritourism represents an evolving form of rural tourism which is targeted at mainly urban consumers. Against the background of a review of international scholarship on agritourism this article explores its potential implications for LED planning in South Africa. A national audit of agritourism is presented which shows its uneven geographical distribution. Agritourism is of special significance for small town economic development in South Africa's intermediate tourism spaces. Policy suggestions are offered for strengthening agritourism as a driver for LED in South Africa. © Bulletin of Geography.

This paper reports the attitudes of the next-generation successors of Educational Dairy Farms (EDF) who are now working on-farm, in comparison with their counterparts working on ordinary dairy farms in Japan, as determined by questionnaire surveys. First, the main findings were that the EDF successors tended to have wider job experience, and longer and more varied training experience across the country and/or abroad than their counterparts in ordinary dairy farms. This means that EDF successors have both a wider perspective and more extensive human networks from social learning opportunities. Second, EDF successors gained high psychological rewards and strengthened their identity as a dairy farmer from the educational activity of the farm, including more self-confidence and pride as a dairy farmer. Third, most successors, however, did not consider the educational service to be economically viable. Thus, in the long term, it will be necessary to levy a service charge to make the educational activity viable. Quality improvement was considered to be a necessary measure for this purpose. © 2014 WIT Press.","Agritourism; Dairy farm; Educational tourism; Farm tourism; Rural tourism","dairy farming; education; rural area; tourism; Japan","","","","","","","Graham, Bill, The work of Farming and Countryside Education (FACE), Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, 165, (2004); Gatward, Gordon, The society's charitable activities, Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, 168, (2007); Symposium on Food Agri Culture and Tourism, (2009); Children S Environments Quarterly, (1995); Ohe, Yasuo, Evaluating jointness of multifunctional agriculture: The educational function of dairy farming in Japan, WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, 98, pp. 337-346, (2006); Ohe, Yasuo, Emerging environmental and educational service of dairy farming in Japan: Dilemma or opportunity?, WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, 106, pp. 425-436, (2007); Ohe, Yasuo, Evaluating internalization of multifunctionality by farm diversification: Evidence from educational dairy farms in Japan, Journal of Environmental Management, 92, 3, pp. 886-891, (2011); Ohe, Yasuo, Operators' attitudes on educational tourism in agriculture, WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, 161, pp. 273-286, (2012)","","Favro, S.; Pineda, F.D.; Brebbia, C.A.; Brebbia, C.A.; Favro, S.; Pineda, F.D.","WITPress marketing@witpress.com","International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning; WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment","6th International Conference on Sustainable Tourism, ST 2014","2014-07-08 through 2014-07-10","Opatija","114792","17433541; 1746448X","9781845645144; 9781845640422; 9781845645328; 1845641736; 9781784663834; 184564042X; 9781845641191; 9781845640880; 9781845647629; 9781845645946","","","English","WIT Trans.

Research concerning the demand and/or supply of rural tourism services has been limited within the agricultural economics domain despite the significance attached to rural tourism by various rural development policy measures and initiatives. The article examines the expenditure behavior of rural tourists within a framework of demand for composite (heterogeneous) goods. The proposed framework captures the quality of the tourism experience as the commodity's unit value, a quantifiable economic variable, examines its effects on expenditures and allows for the estimation of elasticity in prices regarding expenditure and quantity. Empirical analysis is facilitated by a survey recording the expenditure behavior of 465 tourists in two rural and lagging areas of Greece. The quality of the tourism experience is significantly and positively affected by the income, the source from which information about the trip is retrieved (Internet, newspapers as well as general press and special travel press) and by the amount of information sought by the consumer prior to the trip. In turn, the quality of the tourism experience is the major endogenous factor that positively influences expenditures for rural tourism. Further research is needed before evidence provided in this work can be used to draw policy conclusions and recommendations. © 2006 International Association of Agricultural Economists.","Agrotourism quality; Composite (heterogeneous) goods; Greece; Information for tourism services; Rural tourism","rural economy; tourism development; tourist behavior; Eurasia; Europe; European Union","","","","","","","Aguiló, Eugeni, The persistence of the sun and sand tourism model, Tourism Management, 26, 2, pp. 219-231, (2005); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Rand Journal of Economics, (1984); Archer, Brian H., The economic impact of tourism in the Seychelles, Annals of Tourism Research, 23, 1, pp. 32-47, (1996); Equilibrium Price Dynamics for an Experience Good, (1986); Briedenhann, Jenny, Tourism routes as a tool for the economic development of rural areas-vibrant hope or impossible dream?, Tourism Management, 25, 1, pp. 71-79, (2004); Callon, Michel, The economy of qualities, Economy and Society, 31, 2, pp. 194-217, (2002); Chang, Huishung, Advertising, information, and product quality: The case of butter, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 73, 4, pp. 1193-1205, (1991); Lifestyles, (1996); Clarke, Jackie, Rural tourism in Roznava Okres: A Slovak case study, Tourism Management, 22, 2, pp. 193-202, (2001)","D.
